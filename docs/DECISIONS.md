# KaamSolv — Decision Log

Short, dated record of decisions that change the product, brand or
infrastructure. Newest first. Detail lives in the linked docs.

## 2026-10-21 — Rebrand: KaamKit → KaamSolv

**Decided by:** product owner.

- The product name is now **KaamSolv**. All user-facing copy, metadata,
  structured data, docs and the package name use it.
- **Domain:** `kaamsolv.com` (registered on Cloudflare). Code uses
  `https://kaamsolv.com` (apex) as the canonical base, same pattern as before:
  `www` should redirect to the apex. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` still overrides it.
- **Logo / colours:** a new logo and colour scheme are coming. Until they are
  supplied, the existing palette and the text wordmark stay — now
  "Kaam**Solv**" with the coral accent on the second half. The old
  `assets/KaamKit — Logo …` files are kept for reference only.
- **Source repo:** moving to a new GitHub account. The old remote
  (`github.com/kaamkitdigital/Website`) is still `origin` until the new
  repository URL is confirmed.
- **Working folder:** renamed `KaamKit` → `KaamSolv`. The folder name has no
  effect on the build. It did break the git worktree links
  (`../KaamKit-*`), which were repaired with `git worktree repair`.

**Deliberately unchanged** (internal, not brand-visible, renaming would break
live configuration):

- `kk-` CSS class prefix (`kk-container`, …).
- `KK_` environment variable prefix (`KK_IP_HASH_SALT`, … on the
  `url-shortener` branch) — already set in hosting.

**Side effects to know about:**

- Theme preference key changed `kaamkit-theme` → `kaamsolv-theme`. A visitor's
  stored light/dark choice resets once. It is a new origin anyway.
- QR downloads are now named `kaamsolv-qr-code.{png,svg,jpg}`.
- Feature branches (`url-shortener`, `feature/image-converters`,
  `cf-workers-poc`) still say KaamKit. Expect small text conflicts when they
  next merge `main`; resolve in favour of KaamSolv.
