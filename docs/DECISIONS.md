# KaamSolv — Decision Log

Short, dated record of decisions that change the product, brand or
infrastructure. Newest first. Detail lives in the linked docs.

## 2026-10-21 — Image converters live

**Decided by:** product owner.

- `feature/image-converters` merged into `main` and deployed: 10 converters
  (JPG, PNG, WEBP, HEIC, AVIF pairs) at `/{from}-to-{to}`, processed in the
  browser. Old `/image-tools/{slug}` paths redirect there. Image Compressor is
  still planned. Product docs: [`products/image-kit.md`](products/image-kit.md).
- Fixed on merge: the result card showed "Original: 0 B" because the input
  buffer was read after being transferred to the Web Worker.
- **Heads-up for the URL Shortener merge:** converters use a root-level
  dynamic route `app/(image-converters)/[slug]`, and the shortener uses
  `app/[shortCode]`. Next.js won't allow both at the root. One must give way
  (e.g. converters as static routes, or the shortener checks converter slugs
  first) — decide at that merge.
- Polish backlog: a non-image file shows a broken preview and the error
  "The source image could not be decoded." — should be caught on drop with
  friendlier copy.

## 2026-10-21 — Hosting: Cloudflare Workers

**Decided by:** product owner.

- KaamSolv is hosted on **Cloudflare Workers** via OpenNext, replacing Vercel.
  Worker `kaamsolv`, Custom Domains `kaamsolv.com` (canonical) and
  `www.kaamsolv.com` (308 → apex). Detail: [`infra/deployment.md`](infra/deployment.md).
- Builds on the `cf-workers-poc` proof of concept. Its URL-Shortener-specific
  runtime changes (Cloudflare geo header, production detection) are still on
  that branch and must come in with the URL Shortener.
- Code repository is now `github.com/kaamsolv/website`; the old one stays as
  remote `kaamkit-old`.
- Upgraded Next.js 16.3.4 → 16.4.2 for a critical advisory (GHSA-vcvr-r3jv-pc5j)
  and because OpenNext requires ≥ 16.4.1.

## 2026-10-21 — Rebrand: KaamKit → KaamSolv

**Decided by:** product owner.

- The product name is now **KaamSolv**. All user-facing copy, metadata,
  structured data, docs and the package name use it.
- **Domain:** `kaamsolv.com` (registered on Cloudflare). Code uses
  `https://kaamsolv.com` (apex) as the canonical base, same pattern as before:
  `www` should redirect to the apex. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` still overrides it.
- **Logo / colours:** a new logo and colour scheme are coming. Until they are
  supplied, the existing palette and the text wordmark stay — now
  "Kaam**Solv**" with the coral accent on the second half. The old
  `assets/KaamKit — Logo …` files are kept for reference only.
- **Source repo:** moved to a new GitHub account (see Hosting entry above).
- **Working folder:** renamed `KaamKit` → `KaamSolv`. The folder name has no
  effect on the build. It did break the git worktree links
  (`../KaamKit-*`), which were repaired with `git worktree repair`.

**Deliberately unchanged** (internal, not brand-visible, renaming would break
live configuration):

- `kk-` CSS class prefix (`kk-container`, …).
- `KK_` environment variable prefix (`KK_IP_HASH_SALT`, … on the
  `url-shortener` branch) — already set in hosting.

**Side effects to know about:**

- Theme preference key changed `kaamkit-theme` → `kaamsolv-theme`. A visitor's
  stored light/dark choice resets once. It is a new origin anyway.
- QR downloads are now named `kaamsolv-qr-code.{png,svg,jpg}`.
- Feature branches (`url-shortener`, `feature/image-converters`,
  `cf-workers-poc`) still say KaamKit. Expect small text conflicts when they
  next merge `main`; resolve in favour of KaamSolv.
